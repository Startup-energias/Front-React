    "Solar energy for treating sea, subterranean or superficial reservoir water to generate drinkable water.",
  categories: ["solar"],
  location: "Buenavista, Riohacha, La Guajira, Colombia",
  description: [
    "Sea for Change is a humanitarian project thought and designed by a team of interdisciplinary young minds that seek to provide water to communities that need it the most.",
    "We created a new concept of a portable machine that utilizes solar energy to desalinize and treat sea, subterranean or superficial reservoir water. It innovates in terms of cost, design and, of course, portability. With each unit, we seek to positively impact up to 30 people by providing them with drinkable water, equivalent to a minimum of 150 litres per day.",
    "We have the machine's first version design, and it's ready to be built,  tested, and optimized. We will destinate the collected funds in this campaign to finance the construction and testing of our prototype collaborating with the Popoya Playa Wayuu indigenous community.",
    "Initially, we want to begin working as soon as possible with the Wayuus, an indigenous community suffering a drinkable water shortage documented for over 40 years. The lack of potable water exists due a couple of reasons including harsh climate conditions (only 100mm of precipitation per year) and the consequences of 30 years of mineral exploitation.",
    "Sea for Change needs your support to bring our prototype to reality and field-test it in Popoya Playa community this year (2021). We are looking forward to scaling this project in 2022, making it economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable and globally accessible. ",
    "We believe in the power of solidarity, technology, water consciousness and collaboration as drivers of progress in people and societies. ",
    "Help us and be an active entity of change!"
